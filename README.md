# Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling----Logistic-Regression

## Objective:
The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential 
customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success 
ratio while at the same time reducing the cost of the campaign. Dataset Description: The 
dataset contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information 
(age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, 
etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among 
these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in 
the earlier campaign.
